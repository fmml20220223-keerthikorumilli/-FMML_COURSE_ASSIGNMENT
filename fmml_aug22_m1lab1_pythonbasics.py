# Getting Started

FMML Module 1, Lab 1 <br>
 Module Coordinator: Amit Pandey ( amit.pandey@research.iiit.ac.in ) <br>
 Release date: Aug 2022 <br>

### In this notebook we will be covering the very basics of Python and some basic libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib and Nltk.
#### It is suggested that you go through each line and try some examples.

#### Section 1 - Python : Basic data types and indexing.
"""

## Strings
'''
A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote,
 double-quote or triple quote. In python there is no character data type,
 a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.

String can have special characters. String can be indexed

'''


name = 'First Lab'
name_extended = name + 'Module 1'
last_element_string = name[-1] # -1 in python is index of the last element. 
## indexing is important for preprocessing of the raw data.

print(name ,"\n", name_extended, "\n", last_element_string)

## List

'''
Lists are ordered collection of data, and are very similar to arrays, 
It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
'''

name_list = ['First Lab', 3 , '1.1' , 'Lab 1'] ## notice elements are of different data type.
name_list.extend(['Module 1']) ## adding elements to list (Read about append method as well).
element_2 = name_list[1] ## Just like other languages, the index starts from 0.
two_dimesional_list = [[1,2],[3,4]] ## practice with multi-dimensional lists and arrays
## you would soon be required to handle 4 dimensional data :p :)
name_list[2] = '1.111' ##list elements can be changed

print(name_list)
print(element_2)
print(two_dimesional_list)
## list can have list, dictionary, string etc.

## Tuples

name_tuple = ('First Lab', 1, (2,3),[1,1,'list having string']) ## A tuple can have a tuple.
 
print(name_tuple[2])
print("first indexing the last element of the tuple, which is a list and \n then last element of the list (a string) and then second last element of the string:")
print(name_tuple[-1][-1][-2])

## tuples are immutable, read the error !
 #usued when passing parameters etc. and dont want them to be changed

name_tuple=list(name_tuple)
name_tuple[1] = 2
name_tuple

## Sets
'''a Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.
The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list,
 is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set.
'''
set_unique = set([1,1,2,3,5,6,'Lab1'])
print(set_unique) ##notice it is unordered
last_el = set_unique.pop()
set_unique.add((1,2))


print(last_el)
print(set_unique)

set_unique=list(set_unique)
set_unique[1]  ##it is not indexable

## Dictionary
'''
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map,
 which, unlike other data types which hold only a single value as an element.
'''


dic = {'1': 'A','2':'B', 'C':3 } ##Observe how key and values can be anything
dic['4'] ='New'
print(dic)
